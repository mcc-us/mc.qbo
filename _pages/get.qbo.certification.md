## How can this Certification Prep lesson help?

Whether you’re excited and ready to take the QuickBooks Online Certification exam or simply want to find out more about what’s involved, these Certification Prep lessons will help you make the right decision.

In this Certification Prep lesson, we’ll answer the most common questions about certification, including:

- What is QuickBooks Online Certification?
- How will certification benefit me, my business, and my clients?
- What training and experience should I have before taking the exam?
- What are the rules of the exam?


## Passing your certification exam is one of the requirements for receiving a free listing on Intuit’s Find-a-ProAdvisor directory, a free marketing channel you can use to grow your practice. Your new Certified ProAdvisor in QuickBooks Online badge will appear along with your listing.



## Tiered benefit levels

As a Certified ProAdvisor, the level of benefits you receive is determined by a points-based tier system. You gain points by completing certifications and adding more clients who use QuickBooks Online. As your points mount up, you level up a tier and unlock further useful benefits and tools to help your practice thrive and grow.

The QuickBooks Online Certification earns you 100 points.

Passing your QuickBooks Online Advanced Certification exam earns you 200 points. And if you decide to take the QuickBooks Online Payroll Certification, you can earn 100 points.

## ProAdvisor preferred pricing and revenue share programs

As a Certified ProAdvisor, you have three ways to manage your client subscriptions. When you pay for your clients’ subscriptions through your firm, you receive an ongoing discount and a single consolidated monthly bill.

For clients who prefer to pay for their subscriptions directly, you can pass on an exclusive discount available only through you. Or, if you enroll your company in the ProAdvisor revenue share program, every time you sign up a client with a new QuickBooks Online and/or Payroll subscription, you’ll receive 30% of the billed price they pay each month for 12 months. Either way, your client is charged directly, so you spend less time managing subscriptions.

To find out more, check out this article on the ProAdvisor Preferred Pricing revenue share program.



## Unlocked certifications

When you become a Certified ProAdvisor in QuickBooks Online, you unlock further certification exams.

Completing the QuickBooks Online Advanced Certification exam earns you the Advanced Certified ProAdvisor in QuickBooks Online title and badge. It also earns you more points and more credibility. You’ll also be more visible on the Find-a-ProAdvisor directory, giving you more opportunities to attract new clients.

You can also take the QuickBooks Online Payroll Certification exam and attract new clients by offering your payroll specialist skills and expertise in QuickBooks Online Payroll.

    Reconciling accounts and making adjustment entries where appropriate

## How the certification exam works


### Navigating the exam


The exam is divided into multiple sections that you can take in any order. When you start the exam, you can see the number of questions and the estimated time of each section.

After you’ve answered all the questions in a section, you’ll get a chance to review your answers and change them if necessary. When you’re happy with your selections, don’t forget to submit the section.

Note that submitted sections are saved, however, you may lose the progress within a section that has not been submitted yet if you leave the exam. So, make sure you have a reliable internet connection and enough time to finish a section before starting it. We also recommend that you only have one tab open for the exam because having multiple windows or tabs open may cause issues with submitting sections.

Once you have completed all the sections, you can submit the whole exam for grading.


###     Pass requirements
    If you don't pass

Sections all done? Time for your grade.

You need to get 80% or higher on each section to pass the exam.

You have 3 attempts to pass the exam, so if you fail the first time, you can try two more times.

###     If you don't pass

If you don’t get the pass grade, use the remaining two attempts to retake the exam.

When retaking the exam, you only need to complete the sections where you scored below 80%, but you’ll need to answer all the questions in those sections again. As before, you’ll have a chance to review your answers before submitting them.

If you don’t pass all of the sections after your third attempt, you’ll be locked out of the exam for 60 days and your progress will be reset. Use this time to review the training content and improve on the areas you struggled with the first time around.

After the 60 days, you can take all the sections of the exam again.



## Keeping your certification up to date



## Topics in the QuickBooks Online Certification exam


To pass the certification exam, you need to show that you can apply best practices when supporting your clients using QuickBooks Online. The exam assesses your ability to support clients with the most common tasks and workflows they need help with.



### How can this Certification Prep lesson help?

This lesson of Certification Prep gives an overview of the most common topics covered in the certification exam, followed by a sample question. Use this lesson to understand the areas the exam will assess you on, and to test your understanding. The feedback in each question points you to the relevant training if you need to brush up on your knowledge. At the end of this lesson, you can decide whether to try more sample exam questions or jump straight to the certification exam.




### QuickBooks Online solutions

Before you jump into supporting your clients with specific tasks in QuickBooks Online, you should always make sure they have the right solution for their needs.

For clients already using QuickBooks Online, you’ll want to validate that their subscription level and installed apps meet their needs. If not, you should recommend a different subscription tier and be able to explain why this would be better for your client.

The QuickBooks Online Certification exam assesses you on:

    The key tools and workflows to use when setting up clients in QuickBooks Online
    Reviewing a client’s existing QuickBooks Online books
    The different subscription options and levels
    Identifying the right QuickBooks Online subscription for a client’s needs
    The pricing and billing options
    The benefits of adding QuickBooks Time and QuickBooks Online Payroll to QuickBooks Online

There are various QuickBooks Online solutions available, and you must be familiar with them all before taking the exam.

To give you a flavor of what you’ll need to know about this, see if you can answer the following question.

This is just a sample—you won’t be scored on your answers!



### Knowledge check

Which 2 QuickBooks Online billing options include a discount on QuickBooks Time?

    ProAdvisor discount
    Direct discount
    Revenue share




### Configuring a QuickBooks Online company

As their Certified ProAdvisor, your clients will depend on your expertise to configure their QuickBooks Online to maximize efficiency and ensure they get the most value.

The certification exam will assess your ability to:

- Customize the chart of accounts
- Import the chart of accounts, products and services, customers, and vendors
- Manage the products and services list
- Manage customers and vendors
- Add and manage users
- Select and add apps

To get a feel for if you’re ready for the exam, try answering the following question.

### Knowledge check

A new client has been using an inconsistent structure and hierarchy in the chart of accounts. You’ve already customized all your other clients’ account numbering to provide a consistent way of working, but your new client doesn’t have account numbering enabled.
Where would you go to enable account numbering in the chart of accounts?

    The Enable account numbers slider from the Chart of Accounts screen
    The Chart of accounts tab in Account and Settings
    The Advanced tab in Account and Settings
    The Customization option from Accountant Tools
