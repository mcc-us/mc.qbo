One of the first things you will do with a new client is set up their company on Quickbooks and their Chart of Accounts.

I'll start with the Chart of Accounts first, arbitrarily.


### Setup: Chart Of Accounts


<script> 
 function openWindow()
 {window.open("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoWghI3kvpc&t=982");}
</script>

<button onclick="openWindow()">Open: Quickbooks Dude Video @ 16:22</button>


1. Goto: Accountant Tools / `Transactions` / `Chart of Accounts`
2. Determine which accounts to use? *Make New / Edit / Inactive*?
3. **Action** column: `New / Edit / Inactive / Run Report` 
4. `New` **OR** `View register` drop down menus

|:-:|

>**NOTE**: It is not possible to make some accounts inactive  
{: .block-warning } 

### Example: Chart of Accounts

- This example chart of accounts includes many common accounts for different situations.
